# 3D Flight Simulator Game

Welcome to the 3D Flight Simulator Game! This is a simple yet immersive browser-based game built using **HTML5**, **JavaScript**, and **Three.js**. In this game, you can take off from an airfield, fly around a large 3D world filled with randomly generated buildings, and attempt to land back on the airfield. The game provides basic flight mechanics with intuitive controls for pitch and yaw, allowing you to explore the dynamic 3D environment.

## What is the Game?

In this 3D flight simulator, you control a plane from a **third-person perspective**. The game features a large 3D world with:
- An **airfield** at the center for takeoffs and landings.
- **Randomly generated buildings** scattered across the landscape.
- A ground plane to simulate terrain.

The plane is represented by a red cone, and you can control its **pitch (up/down)** and **yaw (left/right)** to take off, fly, and land. The camera dynamically follows the plane, providing an engaging view of your flight path.

### Key Features

- **3D Graphics**: Powered by **Three.js**, delivering an immersive 3D experience directly in your browser.
- **Flight Controls**: Use arrow keys to control the plane's pitch and yaw.
- **Airfield**: A gray runway located at the center of the world for takeoffs and landings.
- **Random Buildings**: 100 uniquely sized and colored buildings populate the landscape, avoiding the airfield area.
- **Physics**: Basic flight mechanics include:
  - Constant forward speed.
  - Gravity affecting the plane's altitude.
  - Boundary checks to keep the plane above the ground.

## Controls

To play the game, use the following keyboard controls:
- **Arrow Up**: Pitch up to climb.
- **Arrow Down**: Pitch down to descend.
- **Arrow Left**: Yaw left to turn left.
- **Arrow Right**: Yaw right to turn right.

### How to Play

1. **Start the Game**:
   - Save the provided HTML code into a file (e.g., `flight_simulator.html`).
   - Open the file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. **Take Off**:
   - The plane starts on the airfield.
   - Press **Arrow Up** to pitch up and climb into the air.
3. **Fly Around**:
   - Use the arrow keys to control the plane's direction.
   - Explore the 3D world and enjoy the scenery.
4. **Land**:
   - Return to the airfield.
   - Gently pitch down to land on the runway.

## Installation

No installation is required! To play:
1. Copy the provided HTML code into a file (e.g., `flight_simulator.html`).
2. Open the file in a modern web browser.
   - Note: The game loads **Three.js** via a CDN, so an internet connection is required to run the game for the first time.

## Notes

- The game uses a **simplified flight model** with constant forward speed and basic gravity. For a more realistic experience, additional features like thrust control, roll, and collision detection could be implemented.
- The buildings are **randomly generated** each time the game is loaded, ensuring a unique landscape for every playthrough.
- The camera follows the plane from behind, offering a smooth **third-person view** of the flight.

## Enjoy Your Flight!
