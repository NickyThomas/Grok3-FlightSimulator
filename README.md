# Flight Simulator Game

This is a simple 2D side-view flight simulator game built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. In this game, you can take off from an airfield, fly around a large world filled with randomly generated buildings, and attempt to land back on the airfield.

## What is the Game?

In this flight simulator, you control a plane in a 2D side-view perspective. The game features a large explorable world spanning from -10,000 to 10,000 units horizontally, with an airfield located at the center (x = -500 to 500). Randomly generated colored blocks represent buildings scattered across the landscape, excluding the airfield area. The background consists of a light blue sky, and the airfield is marked by a gray runway. Basic physics, including gravity and boundary checks, keep the gameplay realistic by ensuring the plane stays on or above the ground.

## Controls

To play the game, use the following keyboard controls:

- **Left Arrow**: Decrease horizontal speed.
- **Right Arrow**: Increase horizontal speed.
- **Up Arrow**: Increase lift (fly upward).
- **Down Arrow**: Decrease lift (descend).

### How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Save the HTML code in a file (e.g., `flight_simulator.html`) and open it in a modern web browser.
2. **Take Off**: Begin on the runway (gray strip at x = 0). Press **Right Arrow** to build speed, then **Up Arrow** to lift off.
3. **Fly Around**: Explore the large world, maneuvering past randomly generated buildings.
4. **Land**: Return to the runway (x = -500 to 500) and gently reduce speed and lift to touch down.

Enjoy your flight!
